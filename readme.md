## üîß Backend Engineering (NestJS + Python)

### **Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architecture**
- Architected dual-backend microservices system (NestJS + Python) with Kafka-based event streaming and shared database for data consistency
- Implemented **Outbox Pattern** for reliable event publishing across services, ensuring zero message loss with transactional guarantees and retry mechanisms
- Designed event-driven video processing pipeline (Upload ‚Üí Transcode ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Index) using Kafka topics and BullMQ/Celery workers
- Built idempotent Kafka consumers using `processed_messages` table to handle at-least-once delivery semantics and prevent duplicate processing

### **Database Architecture & Performance**
- Implemented **Repository Pattern** with generic CRUD abstractions across both Node.js and Python backends for consistent data access
- Designed connection pooling strategies (TypeORM: 10+20 connections, SQLAlchemy: 10+20) for optimal database resource management
- Built comprehensive video search with OpenSearch integration including fuzzy matching, autocomplete, and cursor-based pagination
- Created status tracking system with `video_status_logs` table for complete audit trail and real-time progress monitoring

### **Video Processing & Streaming**
- Engineered multipart video upload system with S3 presigned URLs, supporting large file uploads with resumable capability and progress tracking
- Implemented HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video transcoding pipeline using FFmpeg, generating adaptive bitrate variants (720p, 1080p) with segment-based streaming
- Built video processing service with FFmpeg integration for transcoding, thumbnail extraction, and HLS playlist generation
- Designed video deletion service with cascading cleanup across S3, database, and OpenSearch, handling both in-progress and completed videos

### **Concurrency & Race Condition Handling**
- Implemented atomic database operations for comment likes using transactions, unique constraints, and raw SQL increment/decrement to prevent race conditions
- Designed idempotent processing with `processed_messages` tracking table to handle Kafka message duplicates and worker failures gracefully
- Built retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for Celery tasks, matching BullMQ retry behavior for consistent failure handling
- Created video status management with atomic updates and conflict resolution for concurrent processing requests

### **Caching & Performance Optimization**
- Implemented Redis Bloom Filter for instant email availability checks, reducing database queries by 99%+ with probabilistic data structures
- Built scheduled email synchronization job using BullMQ to populate Bloom Filter from PostgreSQL, enabling O(1) lookup performance
- Designed Redis-based caching layer with TTL management for frequently accessed data (user info, video metadata)
- Implemented connection pooling and query optimization strategies to handle concurrent requests efficiently

### **API Design & Authentication**
- Architected RESTful API with NestJS using dependency injection, modular structure, and custom interceptors for response transformation
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with Passport.js, including token blacklisting in Redis for secure logout functionality
- Built comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI including request/response schemas and authentication requirements
- Designed pagination strategies (offset-based and cursor-based) for efficient large dataset retrieval

## ü§ñ GenAI Integration (Python Backend)

### **AI-Powered Video Processing**
- Built end-to-end transcription pipeline using OpenAI Whisper, extracting audio from videos, transcribing with segment-level timestamps, and storing results in S3 and database
- Implemented **Map-Reduce summarization** pattern using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, processing long transcripts in chunks (8000 tokens) and recursively combining summaries for coherent final output
- Designed cost-optimized AI pipeline with batching (5 chunks per batch) to minimize API calls and handle rate limits gracefully
- Created quality scoring algorithm for generated summaries, evaluating coherence and relevance using multiple metrics

### **Distributed Task Processing**
- Architected Celery-based task queue system with Redis broker, supporting asynchronous processing with configurable concurrency and exponential backoff retries
- Implemented thread-local OpenAI client management to handle Celery worker concurrency and avoid proxy conflicts
- Built Kafka consumer workers in Python for consuming `video.transcoded` and `video.transcribed` events, queuing Celery tasks with idempotency checks
- Designed task failure handling with status updates, error logging, and automatic retry mechanisms (max 3 retries with exponential backoff)

### **Event Publishing & Reliability**
- Implemented shared Outbox Pattern across NestJS and Python backends, writing events to `outbox_events` table in same transaction as business data
- Built centralized event publisher scheduler in NestJS that polls outbox every 5 seconds and publishes to Kafka, ensuring reliable delivery even if Kafka is down
- Designed event versioning and payload structure for inter-service communication with correlation IDs and timestamps
- Created service tagging (`service="python-backend"` or `"nest-be"`) to track event origins and enable service-specific handling

## üé® Frontend (Next.js) - "Vibe Coded"

### **Modern UI/UX**
- Built responsive, modern video platform UI using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with gradient designs and backdrop blur effects
- Implemented real-time video processing status updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE) with automatic reconnection and progress timeline visualization
- Created video player component with HLS.js integration for adaptive bitrate streaming, quality selection, and playback controls
- Designed intuitive video upload interface with drag-and-drop, progress tracking, and multipart upload support

### **User Experience Features**
- Implemented search functionality with debounced autocomplete (3+ character minimum), real-time suggestions, and fuzzy matching
- Built comprehensive video watch page with collapsible AI summaries, captions, comments section, and video information cards
- Created video processing dashboard with pagination, status filtering, expandable timelines, and delete/cancel functionality
- Designed user profile management with authentication flows (signup/login), email validation, and session management

### **Performance & Optimization**
- Implemented custom hooks for debouncing, authentication state management, and video status streaming
- Built modular component architecture with reusable UI components (Button, Card, Input) and feature-based organization
- Designed API client layer with centralized error handling, request interceptors, and type-safe API methods
- Created responsive layouts with dark mode support, smooth animations, and mobile-first design approach
